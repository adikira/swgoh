# One time setup
1.  Install NOX on your PC.
2.  Install SWGOH in the NOX instance.
3.  Launch SWGOH.
4.  Go to Store.
5.  Go to purchase Bronzium Data cards with Ally points.
6.  Overlay a key, **Q**, over the button to buy
    -   It needs to be *Q* to match what's in the AHK script, else you need to change in both places.
    -   Place the *Q* in the center of the button (it needs to fall on the *Continue* button when you get a shard). If it gets stuck on *Continue* and doesn't progress then you need to reposition the *Q*.
7.  Install AHK (auto hot key) from <https://www.autohotkey.com/>.
8.  Download swgoh.ahk script from <https://github.com/adikira/swgoh>.
9.  Customize swgoh.ahk (open it in Notepad or similar text editor to edit it).
    -   Update *startSwgoh()* with your URL to the NOX link. This is optional, if you installed NOX in a non-standard way and want the script to start NOX if it's not started. If you start NOX manually or installed NOX the standard way don't worry about it.

# Converting ally points
1.  Launch NOX.
2.  Launch SWGOH in the NOX instance.
3.  Go to Store.
4.  Go to purchase Bronzium Data cards with Ally points.
5.  Launch swgoh.ahk.
6.  Take coffee break, a nap or whatever and come back when all the Ally points have been converted.
7.  Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S to stop the script (the key combination can be customized in the swgoh.ahk script).

# Notes
IMHO, converting Ally points is, overall, a better choice than using them to buy from shipments. EA/CG always makes the easier option (in this case, shipments) more expensive/less valuable. The idea is that you pay a premium on convenience: you don't have patience to convert Ally points then you get less value.

Converting Ally points gives you:

1.  Shards
    -   It helps you get characters closer to 7\* without wasting energy.
    -   The shards you get for characters you already have at 7\* can be used in the shard store.
2.  Gear
    -   Occasionally you may get valuable gear (for example purple gear).
    -   The gear you get and don't need can be used for relics.
